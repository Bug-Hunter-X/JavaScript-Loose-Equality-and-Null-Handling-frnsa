# JavaScript Loose Equality and Null Handling

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error related to loose equality (==) and null value handling.  The `bug.js` file showcases the issue, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version using strict equality (===).

## Description

Loose equality (==) in JavaScript performs type coercion before comparison, leading to potential unexpected behavior. This is particularly true when dealing with `null` values.  The example shows that using loose equality in a conditional statement can lead to unexpected null handling that may not address all possibilities.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the correct way to handle `null` values and achieve the desired behavior using strict equality (===). Strict equality prevents type coercion and ensures that only values of the same type and value are considered equal.  This approach is more reliable and helps prevent unexpected errors.
